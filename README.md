# Starter CSS for the WordPress Block Editor

It's awfully hard to remember the markup, classes, and options for all the new blocks in WordPress. This project aims to document that information in an easy-to-grab starter stylesheet for WordPress themes.

## Potential Roadmap

- [ ] Keep updated with future versions for WordPress
- [ ] Add SCSS versions
- [ ] Include relevant PHP functions for theme support (?)
- [ ] Support for package managers(?)
